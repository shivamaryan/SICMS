# SICMS
We successfully completed a department project, involving the digitalization of the paper based Student Index Card Management System.<br>
We have some base functionalities, where some of the work could be done by the user(Student) <br>
and some of which, has Admin(Staff) functionalities.<br>
We will attach a video soon, as we believe, visualiaztion is always better than text reading.<br>
<br>

Relevant technologies that you may find here : 
<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript(very little, am afraid)</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>MySQL</li>

</ol>
No fancy technology or rocket science SQL commands are used(albeit, Simple ones are used), so try to learn the basics from them.<br>
Enjoy :)
